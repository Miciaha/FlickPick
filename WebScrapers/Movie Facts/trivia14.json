{"_id": "14", "title": "The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring", "trivia": "The cast often had to fly to remote shoot locations by helicopter. Sean Bean (Boromir) was afraid of flying, and would only do it when absolutely necessary. When they were shooting the scenes of the Fellowship crossing the snowy mountains, he'd spend two hours every morning, climbing from the base of the mountain, to the set near the top, already dressed as Boromir. The crew being flown up, could see him from their helicopters.", "image": "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/interesting-movie-facts-2-59a80cedbf51e__700.jpg"}
