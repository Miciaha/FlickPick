{"_id": "33", "title": "The Theory Of Everything", "trivia": "Eddie Redmayne met with Stephen Hawking only once before filming. \"In the three hours I spent with him, he said maybe eight sentences,\" recalls Redmayne. \"I just didn't feel like I could ask him intimate things.\" Therefore, he found other ways to prepare for the role. He lost about 15 pounds and trained for four months with a dancer to learn how to control his body. He met with 40 ALS patients, kept a chart tracking the order in which Hawking's muscles declined, and stood in front of a mirror for hours on end, contorting his face. Lastly, he remained motionless and hunched over between takes, so much so that an osteopath told him he had altered the alignment of his spine. \"I fear I'm a bit of a control freak,\" Redmayne admits. \"I was obsessive. I'm not sure it was healthy.\"", "image": "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/interesting-movie-facts-62-5a56040ea3c43__700.jpg"}
