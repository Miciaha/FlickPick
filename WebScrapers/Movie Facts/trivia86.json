{"_id": "86", "title": "Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles", "trivia": "All the actors playing vampires were required to hang upside down for up to thirty minutes at a time during the make-up application. This would force all the blood in their bodies to rush to their heads, causing the blood vessels in their faces to bulge out. The make up artists would then trace over the swollen veins creating the eerie translucent-skinned vampire look. Unfortunately for the actors, they would have to repeat the process several times over, as the blood would quickly drain from their heads. This, in part, accounts for the lengthy make-up process.", "image": "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Interesting-Movie-Facts-59a96d871659e__700.jpg"}
