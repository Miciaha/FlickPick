{"_id": "97", "title": "Sunshine", "trivia": "Cillian Murphy worked with leading physicist Brian Cox to learn all about advanced physics. This included touring the CERN facility in Switzerland and learned to copy physicists' mannerisms. Murphy ended up copying some of Cox's personal idiosyncrasies, such as his frequent hand movements. The actor also studied Henri-Georges Clouzot's classic The Wages of Fear (1953) to have an understanding of the type of suspense that Danny Boyle was attempting to create. Murphy has claimed that his involvement in Sunshine converted him from agnosticism to atheism.", "image": "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Interesting-Movie-Facts-5a2a5fd332d6c__700.jpg"}
