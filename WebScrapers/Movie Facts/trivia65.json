During auditions, director Guy Ritchie was very bothered by his look, though he liked his performance, and asked him four times during the process about his poor physique. Hunnam said that when Ritchie brought up the fourth time, he told Ritchie, \"Look, dude, you keep bringing this up, the physicality. It's obviously your primary concern. So if you want to do away with all this auditioning bollocks, I'll fucking fight those other two dudes. I know who they are. You can bring them both in here. I'll fight them both. The one who walks out the door gets the job.\" Hunnam won the role.", "image": "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/interesting-movie-facts-118-5a56355889220__700.jpg"}
